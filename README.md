# DiffractionPatterns
C++ Project to calculate diffraction patterns using raylib.
## What is the physics behind it?
Diffraction patterns emerge when waves from two different sources superpose with each other. 
This is due to the difference in phases between two "rays" of light.
When the rays of light are IN phase they will add their amplitudes, and when they are out of phase they will subract (really an addition but with a negative value).
This is an oversimplification, however it makes sense.
## Then what are we doing here?
We have many formulae, \( n(\lambda) = d \sin(\theta) \) for example to work out the interactions with waves and double slit interference patterns.
What I would like to do however is use a simulation with "rays" of light to more intuitively understand the interactions of these interfering waves.
